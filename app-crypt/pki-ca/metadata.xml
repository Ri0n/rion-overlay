 The Dogtag Certificate Authority is a required PKI subsystem which issues,
 renews, revokes, and publishes certificates as well as compiling and
 publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
 The Dogtag Certificate Authority can be configured as a self-signing
 Certificate Authority (CA), where it is the root CA, or it can act as a
 subordinate CA, where it obtains its own signing certificate from a public CA.
